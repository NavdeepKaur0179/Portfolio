<h1>Hyperlink pseudo-classes</h1>
<p>Use the link below to test the pseudo-class settings on hypertext.<p>

<p>By default (and until you click on the link to open it), it should appear green and underlined.
After you click on it and return to this page, the font color will be red.
If you point to the text without clicking on it, it will change to a blue color in a cursive font, with no underlining.
As you click on the link, the font will change to bold. You can test this by pointing to the text and holding down the left mouse button.</p>
